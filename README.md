# XeCentral project

#### Just a small static project react project 💅

While playing(newbie) with react styled-components ([**emotion**](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)), I created some
reusable components(20+) of my own. So I decided to put together this static project to showcase all the components and
their inner working. (No DB involved), site data is generated on the fly and stored in a Global State (Context API)

###### Live at [central.mpilo.live](https://central.mpilo.live)

###### Some of the component are:

- `<Drawer/>`

- `<Collapsible/>`

- `<DropMenu/>`

- `<Modal/>`

- `<Snackbar/>`

- `<Modal/>`

- `<Tabs/>`

- ***.... and many more (in src📁)***
